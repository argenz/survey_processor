# survey_processor
During my internship @ Digital Society School I used conditional analysis to gain deeper insights on a survey we conducted with google forms. 
The survey answers were transferred automatically in a google spreadsheet thanks to a google form functionality.
I used the Google Spreadsheets API to extract the data. 
I then processed it using one to three conditions, and plotted it.
